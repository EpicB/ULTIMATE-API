/* if you want For the production environment, we should add another
file: appsettings.Production.json:
The appsettings.Production.json file should contain the
configuration for the production environment.
To set which environment our application runs on, we need to set up the
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable. For example, to run
the application in production, we need to set it to the Production value on
the machine we do the deployment to.
We can set the variable through the command prompt by typing set
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production in Windows or export
ASPNET_CORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production in Linux.
  If we take a look at our launchSettings.json file, we are going to see
that this variable is currently set to Development.
